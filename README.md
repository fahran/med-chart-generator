# med-chart-generator
Generates spreadsheets to print out and track medication across multiple days.
Format inspired by my user's current process - fancier alternatives to follow.

### Usage
Run main.py. It will ask a series of questions that describe a course of medication, and output the resultant schedule to medications.xlsx.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
